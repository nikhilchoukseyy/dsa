# Given an integer array nums, find the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset of nums and return the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.

# An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b. Two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.

# The bitwise OR of an array a is equal to a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1] (0-indexed).

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 3. There are 2 subsets with a bitwise OR of 3:
# - [3]
# - [3,1]

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [2,2,2]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: All non-empty subsets of [2,2,2] have a bitwise OR of 2. There are 23 - 1 = 7 total subsets.

# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [3,2,1,5]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset is 7. There are 6 subsets with a bitwise OR of 7:
# - [3,5]
# - [3,1,5]
# - [3,2,5]
# - [3,2,1,5]
# - [2,5]
# - [2,1,5]
